Script in Python which helps to understand RAG approach (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using in work with Large Language Models.
It's based on framework Llama_index (version 0.9). This agent use .csv file from Kaggle with data of world university. 
The idea of work is creating a questions about the rank of Top Worldwide University and using external structured database.
