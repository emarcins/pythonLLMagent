# Small LLM Agent  :file_folder:
</br>
A Python script to help understand the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to working with large language models.
</br>
</br>
It's based on the "Llama-index" framework (version 0.9). This agent uses a .csv file from Kaggle with data of world universities.
</br>
The idea of this work is to create questions about the ranking of the best universities in the world and use an external structured database.
</br>
You can get the answer with LLM (in this project I use the 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613' model).
</br>
Each response is also saved in a notes.txt file (located in the /data folder).
